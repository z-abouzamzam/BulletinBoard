About
-------
This is a command line bulletin board application written in c++. Its functionalities include creating messages, replying to them, and data saving.

How to Run
-------
I've included a Makefile to compile the code. As in standard practices, `Make all` will compile all the code into `main.out`, while `Make clean` removes the compiled files. Running `main.out` requires two command line arguments, the first is the user file, and the second is the data file, like this: `./main.out users1.txt data.txt`. Both files are included with the code. 

The default username is "user". Password is "password".
